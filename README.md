Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the MathQuiz App locally.

1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/mathquiz_app.git](https://github.com/your-username/mathquiz_app.git)
cd mathquiz_app
```
2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install Requirements
Install all necessary Python packages.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Set Up MySQL Database
Ensure you have MySQL installed and running. Then, create the database schema and populate it with initial data.
```
# Connect to MySQL as root and run schema and seed data
mysql -u root -p < schema.sql
mysql -u root -p < seed_data.sql
# If you have test_data.sql for local testing, you might run it here too:
# mysql -u root -p < test_data.sql
```
5. Run the Application
Start the Flask development server.
```
flask run
```
The app will typically be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

6. Run Tests
To run the unit tests and generate a coverage report:
```
pytest --cov
```
This will execute all tests defined in test_app.py and generate a coverage report in the htmlcov/ directory.

Docker Instructions
To build and run the application using Docker:
```
docker build -t mathquiz_app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 mathquiz_app
```
Note: When running with Docker, ensure your container or host is connected to a MySQL instance and that the necessary environment variables (e.g., DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME) are set correctly for the application to connect to the database.

Future Improvements
. Admin Panel: Develop an administrative interface for managing users, quizzes, and question content.

. Leaderboards & Achievements: Implement a system to track and display user performance, fostering friendly competition.

. Mobile-Responsive Design: Enhance the UI/UX for seamless access and optimal display on various mobile devices.

. Export Quiz Reports: Add functionality to export detailed quiz performance reports to PDF format.

. API Endpoints: Create RESTful API endpoints for external integrations and data access.
